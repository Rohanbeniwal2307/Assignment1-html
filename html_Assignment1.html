    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research-as long as the subjects fall 
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just 
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we are most intrigued by
        are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benifits of Resveratrol(C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>measuring the effect on performance of Funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30°C( 86°F),when the 
                audience size exponentially increase(effect of 3*10^3 increasing to 3*10^4.)</li>
                <li>HTML and CSS construct for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
        <p>
            so please can you provide more information on each of the subject, including how long you'd expect the 
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    
        <p>
            Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, 
            my favourite dances are as follows with definitions: 
        </p>
       <p> 
        polynesian chicken dance
      </p> 
            <blockquote>
                A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around 
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
            </blockquote>
          <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p> 
           <blockquote>
            Before the icelanders developed fire as a mean of getting warm, they used to practice their dance, which 
               involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around imperceptibly 
               tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow student use to say that he thought this dance inspired 
               modern style such as Twerking.
           </blockquote>
               
            <p>Arectic robot dance</p>
            <blockquote>
                an interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic" stilled movements, being practiced by inhabitants 
            of Northern Alaska and canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
            because they were really cold.  
            </blockquote>
